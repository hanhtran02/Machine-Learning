    "## 4: GMM better than Kmeans examples:\n",
    "- GMM can deal with arbitrarily shaped data while Kmeans can only do best with circular shaped data\n",
    "- When there is uncertainty about # of clusters and usual methods (Elbow/Silhouette) doesn't help in finding the optimal number of clusters. \n",
    "- Kmeans is hard clustering (each object belongs to only one cluster) so in case of overlapped clusters, it will do bad. >< GMM, which is a soft clustering (output: probability that an object belongs to a cluster)\n",
    "- Some cluster maybe wider than others => GMM does better with this type since it has the mixing coefficients (or weights)"
